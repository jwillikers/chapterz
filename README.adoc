A script to help with creating audiobook chapters for {MusicBrainz}.

== Usage

The script can extract the chapter metadata from an M4B file using {tone}, from an Audible ASIN, or from a MusicBrainz Release ID and format it for import into MusicBrainz or in the `chapters.txt` format for tone.
An second script, `embed-chapterz.nu` can embed chapters in an M4B file given the source of the chapters.
The scripts only require {Nushell} and {tone}, both of which are cross-platform.
For Linux and macOS users, this repository contains a {Nix} package which will take care of the dependencies for you.
Here are the steps for using the script.

. If not using {Nix}, install {Nushell} and {tone}.

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/chapterz.git
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd chapterz
----

. If you're using {nix-direnv}, described in more detail in the <<Develop>> section, simply run `direnv allow` to take care of the dependencies.

. Now, the provided script can be run like so.
+
--
[,sh]
----
./chapterz.nu book.m4b
----

Alternatively, if you're using Nix but not using `nix-direnv`, you can run `nix build` and then execute the script in the resulting build output with `result/bin/chapterz.nu`.
--

. Now edit the output from the previous command as necessary and paste it in the _Add medium_ dialog in MusicBrainz.

The `embed-chapterz.nu` script can be used in the same manner.
I takes an M4B file as its first argument and either a MusicBrainz Release ID, an Audible ASIN, or the path to a `chapters.txt` file as its second argument.

== A Little More Detail

Unfortunately, MusicBrainz doesn't support down to the millisecond level in their editor yet.
See the issue https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/MBS-7130[MBS-7130].
This requires rounding the track lengths to the nearest second.
When considering these track lengths as only track lengths, there's not much of a problem here.
However, these track lengths can be used to determine the chapter offsets for chapters in an M4B file.
That's something that is very desirable for M4B's which may have chapter markings that are wrong or not even named at all.
Across multiple tracks, the rounding error in the track lengths can accumulate to the point where the resulting chapter offsets are no longer accurate.
To accommodate this, I take into account the cumulative rounding error and round in whichever direction minimizes the total error.
This should keep the chapter offsets generated from the track lengths within half a second of their true position.

== Develop

The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
Nix also generates the configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which automates formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment using Nix.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Permit the direnv configuration for the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
